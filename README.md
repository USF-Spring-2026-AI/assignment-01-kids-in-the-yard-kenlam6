Which tool(s) did you use?
● ChatGPT
If you used an LLM, what was your prompt to the LLM?
● I gave it the same promt as the assignment: Implementation
For this part of the assignment you will build a family tree. This family tree will begin with two people born
in 1950 (“the first two people”), their children, grandchildren, etc. until no more children can be generated
or until 2120, whichever comes first. Once generated, you will use this family tree for reporting. As a
running example, we may assume the first two people born in 1950 are named “Desmond Jones” and
“Molly Jones” (née “Molly Smith”).
What differences are there between your implementation and the LLM?
● It adds alot of extra stuff that wasnt needed and error checks everywhere
What changes would you make to your implementation in general based on suggestions from the
LLM?
● add extra edge case cant hurt
What changes would you refuse to make? the extra work of adding errors markers all over and creating functions that wasnt required
